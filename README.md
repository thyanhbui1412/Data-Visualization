In analyzing student debt among Americans, I was curious to see if gender plays any difference to student debt and income. As a woman, it makes me question the "why" as my data shows that female bear a higher student debt than the median debt and make less than male. This applies to all regions across the States albeit certain regions see a closer gap in debt and income between the two genders. These findings is not neccesarily due to gender inequality, as I want to be neutral, positive and hopeful. 

*I did some further research reading after this EDA, there are several underlying reasons which I am happy to have a conversation about. Ping me at my LinkedIn. ^_^*
